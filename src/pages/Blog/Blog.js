                                                    useState is the first tool you should reach for to manage state in your components.

                                                    It can take accept any valid data value, including primitive and object values. Additionally, its setter function can be passed down to other components as a callback function (without needing optimizations like useCallback).</p>

                                                <p> The Prototypal Inheritance is a feature in javascript used to add methods and properties in objects. It is a method by which an object can inherit the properties and methods of another object. Traditionally, in order to get and set the [[Prototype]] of an object, we use Object.getPrototypeOf and Object.</p>

                                                    Unit testing is an important step in the development process, because if done correctly, it can help detect early flaws in code which may be more difficult to find in later testing stages.</p>

                                                    Just a couple of years ago, developers were mainly debating whether they should be using Angular vs React for their projects. But over the course of the last couple of years, weâ€™ve seen a growth of interest in a third player called Vue.js.

                                                    If you are a developer starting out on a project and cannot decide on which JavaScript framework to use, this guide should help you make a decision.</p>
